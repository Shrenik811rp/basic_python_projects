# AI Hand Pose Estimation with MediaPipe and Python

- MediaPipe Hands is a high-fidelity hand and finger tracking solution.
- It employs machine learning (ML) to infer 21 3D landmarks of a hand from just a single frame. Whereas current state-of-the-art approaches rely primarily on powerful desktop environments for inference, our method achieves real-time performance on a mobile phone, and even scales to multiple hands. 
- Hand perception functionality to the wider research and development community will result in an emergence of creative use cases, stimulating new applications and new research avenues.

## Demo of what it can do:
![demo](https://github.com/kulin-patel/Hand-Tracking/blob/master/test_output.gif?raw=true)<br>
I have made hand-gesture-tracking. It processes the input from web camera.Then, It can identifies 21 landmark points of hands.<br> It runs on CPU.<br> Not need for GPU. In this project, I have also added live FPS tracker too. <br>It measure frame per Second on Webcam. I have done this with OpenCV and Mediapipe.
